            <h2>Bank System Hierarchy Files</h2>
                <div class="text-container">
                    <p>The Bank System is composed of three primary files. Each file contains and implements a set of banking operations as shown below:</p>

                    <h3>App.java File</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>App</strong> class responsible for managing user interactions and file operations. This file contains and implements the following methods:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">loadUserData:</span> This method is only called upon running the app. It loads user data from a CSV file (permanent storage) into the temporary storage of the application . If no CSV file exists, the application starts with an empty user list.</li>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">saveUserData:</span> This method is only called upon closing the app. It saves user data to the permanent storage (CSV file).</li>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">generateRoutingNumber:</span> This method is to generate a unique routing number for a new user. Bank users must have unique routing numbers associated their accounts.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>A routing number is composed of 10 random digits, and it is randomly generated by the system.</li>
                                        <li>A routing number may start with zeros (e.g., 0007742318). That means routing numbers should be treated as strings to avoid discarding zeros at the beginning if they were to be treated as numbers.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">signUp:</span> This method is to allow new users to create an account.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Users can register by providing their full name, username, password, email, and initial deposit amount. Each account is assigned a unique routing number.</li>
                                        <li>An arrayList (temporary storage) should be used to store the user data during the runtime. The elements of the arrayList are the records in the CSV file (permanent storage).</li>
                                        <li>Users must have <strong>unique emails</strong>. An email is composed of user's <strong>username</strong> followed by <strong>@bank.com </strong>(e.g., jsmith@bank.com).</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">logIn:</span> This method is to allow existing users to log in and perform banking operations.</li>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">main:</span> This method is the entry point of the application.</li>
                            </ul>

                    <h3>User.java File</h3>
                        <p>The <strong>User</strong> class representing a bank user, implementing the BankActions interface. The <strong>User</strong> class is also used as a base class of another class (subclass) called <strong>RegularUser</strong>.</p>
                        <p>The <strong>User</strong> class file contains and implements the following methods:</p>

                                <li><span class="colored-word">home:</span> Displays user's account information page.</li>

                                        <li>When depositing into the checking account including the initial deposit when signing up:</li>

                                                <li>2% of the deposit amount is added to the savings account balance.</li>
                                                <li>The remaining amount (98%) is added to the checking account balance.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">withdraw:</span> Allows user to withdraw funds from their account.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>When withdrawing from the savings account:</li>
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>5% of the withdrawal amount is designated as a withdrawal fee.</li>
                                                <li>Ensures that the withdrawal amount plus the withdrawal fee does not exceed the savings account balance.</li>
                                                <li>The withdrawal amount plus the withdrawal fee is deducted from the savings account balance.</li>
                                            </ul>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">update:</span> Allows user to update their account information.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Users can only update their full names and passwords.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <li><span class="colored-word">transfer:</span> Allows user to transfer funds to another account.</li>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Users can transfer money only to accounts within the same bank (internal accounts). For example, if a user attempts to transfer money to an account with the email 'example@gmail.com', the system will generate an error message. The message will state that the recipient's email must be associated with the bank's domain, such as '@bank', rather than an external domain like '@gmail'.</li>
                                        <li>By default, all money transfers are done on <strong>checking</strong> accounts.</li>

                        <p><span class="highlighted">The <strong>User</strong> class file also contains and implements the <strong>RegularUser</strong> class. The <strong>RegularUser</strong> class is a subclass of the <strong>User</strong> class (inherited from the User class) representing regular bank users. The purpose of using the <strong>RegularUser</strong> class is to give users different account priviliages. In this case, all users have regular account privileges. The <strong>RegularUser</strong> class contains and implements only one method:</span></p>

                    <p>Your implementation must adhere to the following programming requirements:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>On the 'Bank System Page', a user can select an option by typing the choice in either uppercase or lowercase.</li>
                            <li>The temporary storage (ArrayList) must hold items of type <strong>User</strong> objects. Therefore, the ArrayList should be declared as <strong>ArrayList&lt;User&gt;</strong>, where <strong>User</strong> is a class.</li>
                            <li>Your implementation of the transfer and withdraw methods must handle 'insufficient funds' scenarios as specified in the sample output.</li>
                            <li>If a user chooses to cancel their account, they should be redirected to the 'Bank System Page' after successful deletion, as specified in the sample output.</li>
                            <li>When copying (writing) data from the temporary storage (ArrayList) to the permanent storage (CSV file), the original data in the CSV file must be overwritten. To achieve this, use <strong>StandardOpenOption.TRUNCATE_EXISTING</strong> when importing the <strong>StandardOpenOption</strong> class from the <strong>nio</strong> package as <strong>java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption</strong>.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <li>Students are required to complete the functionality of their final project and submit it on Canvas by <strong>Friday, November 15, 2024</strong>. A comprehensive description of the final project will be posted on Canvas on <strong>Monday, September 30, 2024</strong>.</li>
                        <li>Students may choose to demonstrate their final project to the professor before submission to ensure its functionality. A zoom-based or face-to-face meetings can be arranaged for this purpose.</li>
                        <li>Late submission will not be accepted for the final project.</li>
                        <li>Students are required to turn in the final project files, which must be ".java" files. They may also choose to compress their entire project package and submit it as a compressed file (e.g., .zip, .rar).</li>
